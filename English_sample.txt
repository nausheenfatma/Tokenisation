Official seal of the city of Sanibel

Sanibel is a city located in Lee County, Florida.  As of the 2000 census, the city had a total population of 6,064. As of 2004, the population recorded by the U.S. Census Bureau is 6,102 .

The city is on Sanibel Island on the Gulf coast of southwestern Florida, and is linked to the mainland by a toll causeway. A short bridge over Blind Pass links Sanibel to the unincorporated town of Captiva on Captiva Island.

The main town is at the eastern end of the island, while the community of Santiva (a portmanteau of Sanibel and Captiva) is at the northwestern end.  The city was formed in 1974 as a direct result of the main causeway being built in 1963 to replace the ferry, and the rampant construction and development that Lee County was allowing to occur afterward.  Developers sued over the new restrictions, but the city and citizens prevailed in their quest to protect the island.  The only buildings above two to three stories now on the barrier island were built during that period.

The most serious hurricane damage in 44 years (since Hurricane Donna in 1960) occurred in August 2004 when Hurricane Charley struck to the north.  Thanks to the city's very strict building codes, very few buildings were seriously damaged, and none were destroyed.  Residents who left before the August 13th storm were not allowed back by the city government until August 18th, due to hundreds of downed Australian pine trees and power lines, and the lack of potable water and sanitary sewer.  A temporary city hall for Sanibel was set up on the mainland in a Fort Myers hotel, until utilities and transport could be restored to the island.

The city's most well-known resident is CIA Director Porter Goss, who represented the area in Congress from 1989 until his appointment in 2004.

Wallingford is a small town in the Thames Valley in southern England.

It is a strategically important crossing point on the River Thames.  During the 1066 Norman conquest of England, the Saxon lord Wigod allowed William the Conqueror's invading armies to cross the Thames from North to South.

Wallingford itself sits on the western side of the Thames; across the river is the village of Crowmarsh Gifford.  The two are linked with a notable 900 ft long stone bridge across the Thames and adjacent floodlands.

Given the town's strategic importance, it has been fortified since at least Saxon times, when it was an important part of the kingdom of Wessex and allowed to mint its own coins.  Since William and his Norman army were permitted to cross the river unopposed, the town received special favor from the Norman conquerors.

The Treaty of Wallingford was signed there in November 1153, ending the Civil War that had begun after Henry I's death.  The town was granted a Royal Charter in 1154 by the new King Henry II, being one of the first towns to receive one (before London, for example).

The Castle was a regular royal residence until the Plague hit the town badly in 1349.  The castle declined subsequently (much stone being removed to renovate Windsor Castle) but it became a Royalist stronghold during the English Civil War.  It was the last holdout of the Royalists in the region, and the castle withstood a 65 day siege.  Oliver Cromwell subsequently ordered the destruction of what was left of the castle and little now remains.

Wallingford has an informal twinning link with Wallingford, Connecticut.
